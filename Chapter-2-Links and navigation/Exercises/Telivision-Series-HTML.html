           <h3> The Walking Dead takes place after the onset of a worldwide zombie apocalypse. The zombies, referred to as "walkers", shamble towards living humans and other creatures to eat them. They are attracted to noise and to scents, including the scent of humans. Humans that are bitten or scratched by walkers die and become walkers themselves. Early in the series, it is revealed that all living humans carry the pathogen responsible for the mutation that turns humans into walkers. Therefore, any human who dies—regardless of the cause of death—will reanimate as a walker. The mutation is activated after the death of the pathogen's host. The only way to permanently kill a walker is to damage its brain or to destroy the body entirely.</h3>

           <h3> Initially, the series centers on sheriff's deputy Rick Grimes, who wakes up from a coma in the first episode of the series. While Rick was comatose, the world was taken over by walkers. Rick becomes the leader of a group of survivors from the Atlanta, Georgia region who attempt to sustain and protect themselves against attacks by walkers and against other groups of survivors willing to use any means necessary to stay alive.</h3>

    <H3> I would put this series my top 5 off all time despite the last few series were a tad disappointing. Maybe COVID affected the script writing but it did tail off.

        Enough of that and on to the good stuff. The early seasons are just phenomenal. It's less about the walkers and more about the characters and relationships they build and the challenges they faced in trying to forge a life amidst the horror around them. And in fact the other people rather than the walkers prove more of a problem to them.
        
        There's so much to keep you on tenterhooks. Stories are told brilliantly, there's genuine terror and fear. A constant menace.
        
        The first 6 series are incredible. There are moments that you'll never forget. Moments that will shake you to your core. Moments that are just 'what the...'
        
        It's genuinely moving at times too and that's where the early seasons are best. It's not a gore fest like the later ones. It's just great TV.
        
        This would have been a clear 10 but for the drawn out ending.</H3>
        
        <H3> I've been a fan of The Walking Dead ever since the first episode of the first season. Even though the quality has gone down in recent years I still haven't missed an episode. While the last few seasons weren't quite as good they were still worth watching. It did go out on a high note though, the last season was actually pretty good. It had a few slow filler episodes but overall it was solid. Even though it was definitely time for it to end I'm still going to miss it. When something's been apart of your life for so long it's hard to say goodbye. The good news for fans is that there are a few spinoffs coming in 2023. I'm actually interested in the spinoffs considering they all star my favorite characters from the main show. There's three of them so far...one with Rick & Michonne, one with Negan & Maggie and one with Darryl going over to Europe. Again, those all happen to be my favorite characters so I'm looking forward to them and hope they're good!</H3>
